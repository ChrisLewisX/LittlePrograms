# LittlePrograms
Within this repository you will find all the little programming projects I have completed.

### CheckPalindrome
A tiny program to check if a String is a palindrome or not.

### ReverseAString
An adaptation of the palindrome project to check if a String is spelt the same backwards as it is forwards.

### GoogleHash2017
A really fun challenge from Google Hash where I was given 4 hours to create a working solution to the problem as part of Salford University's Computer Society Hackathon
